# Car Safety

A project that detects when a driver is sleeping at the wheel and attempts to wake them up.

## Inspiration

According to the National Sleep Foundation, about half of U.S. adult drivers admit to consistently getting behind the wheel while feeling drowsy. About 20% admit to falling asleep behind the wheel at some point in the past year â€“ with more than 40% admitting this has happened at least once in their driving careers. And a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimated that 328,000 drowsy driving crashes occur annually.

Being drowsy behind the wheel makes a person 3x more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle accident, and driving after going more than 20 hours without sleep is the equivalent of driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08% - the legal limit.
